                I started working as a designer and front-end developer in Schibsted Classifieds Media Ventures in 2012.<br><br>
                We launched "clones" of the Swedish success <strong>Blocket</strong> in ~25 countries from Stockholm with a team of less than 30 people.

                The design and branding is a bit dated and rough due to the fact that we focused <em>heavily</em> on growth and quick experiments.<br><br>
                Many of the sites we launched are today some of the biggest sites in their respective countries and have had time to be improved on since.

                We were forced to make some <em>really</em> simple sites for some countries, like Nigeria and Ghana who were behind when it comes to smart phones and internet speed. It was really fun and challenging to build sites with as high site speed as possible.
