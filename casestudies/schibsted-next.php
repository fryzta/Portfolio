                Schibsted Next was an incubator within Schibsted where a team of ~30 people in Stockholm came up with new marketplace ideas and tried to make them to grow as fast as possible.<br><br>
                Some of the ideas were a second hand clothing app, an online car shop, and a second hand gift card marketplace.

                Every project started of with a business model canvas, a lot of research including interviews, surveys, prototyping, experimenting and guerilla testing to validate every idea thoroughly.
